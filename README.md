## Current Projects


- **Airport Travel Assistant App: JetSetGo**  
  Jet Set Go is a smart travel assistant app built for Bandaranaike International Airport in Sri Lanka. It enhances the passenger experience by     
  offering features such as document upload and management, special assistance requests, transport coordination, and real-time flight tracking via 
  a secure airport API. Developed using Flutter and Firebase, the app supports both online and offline functionality, ensuring reliability and 
  accessibility throughout the journey. The project emphasizes clean UI/UX design and user-friendly navigation tailored for diverse traveler needs.

- **AI powered Journaling web app: Reflekt**  
  Reflekt is an AI-powered assistant designed to help users deeply understand, analyze, and iterate on their work‚Äîwhether it's documents, code, or    creative content. Built with a strong focus on context retention and conversation flow, Reflekt supports seamless collaboration, version control, 
  and intelligent suggestions tailored to the user's intent. The project is currently under active development, with ongoing enhancements to its 
  natural language capabilities, file handling, and productivity features.

- **Weather web app: Cumulus**
  Cumulus is a sleek and responsive weather web app that delivers real-time forecasts with an intuitive and interactive UI. Developed using React, 
  TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion, the app features a dynamic search bar with location suggestions, animated weather visuals, and clean 
  design for a smooth user experience. Cumulus was built as a portfolio project to demonstrate frontend proficiency, modern UI design, and API 
  integration best practices.
  
- **Ticketing system simulation API**
  This is an ongoing Java project that simulates a real-time ticketing system using the Producer-Consumer pattern and multithreading, where vendors   (producers) release tickets and customers (consumers) retrieve them from a shared pool. While the Spring Boot-based API is still under     
  development, a separate Java CLI version is already available and fully functional, running on the terminal to demonstrate core simulation logic 
  and concurrency handling.
